    "# Geometric primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "When only geometric information is available, there are still ways to extract some level of distinctness by using differential geometry.\n",
    "We shortly introduce key concepts related to the use of geometric information.\n",
    "In this work, the notion of a shape $\\mathcal{S}$ is used as a representation of a generic object in the Euclidean space with a certain set of properties.\n",
    "For example, those properties can be photometric, thermic, and semantic. \n",
    "Simple shapes, such as points, lines, quadrics, can be easily parametrized, but most of the shapes encountered in the a real environment are too complex to be completely synthesized with parameters.\n",
    "To allow a certain representation of the world, a complex shape $\\mathcal{S}$ can be approximated by a set of other shapes only if they can be expressed in the same frame of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors measuring depth produce such approximations by sampling the environment and producing a set of points. \n",
    "From smooth areas defined by those points, we present five types of primitives that can be extracted based on _differential geometry_: point, line, plane, curve and quadric. \n",
    "The first derivative group rely on normal vectors $\\mat{n}$ (i.e., a vector orthogonal to a line or plane) and tangent vectors $\\mat{t}$ (i.e. a vector parallel to a line or plane) to express the local area.\n",
    "Since they are defined with respect to a point $\\mat{p}$, normal and tangent vectors can be represented with a minimal set of two angles in polar coordinates.\n",
    "Normal and tangent vectors can be seen as a dual representation.\n",
    "The choice of using either one or the other is defined by the minimum information required to express a primitive.\n",
    "In the case of a line in 3D, the normal vectors needs to define a plane perpendicular to that line. \n",
    "Therefore, only using the tangent vector is more convenient.\n",
    "The same reasoning holds for using a normal vector for the surface.\n",
    "The notion of direction also needs to be defined depending of the primitive.\n",
    "It is reasonable to use unsigned direction in the case of tangents and signed direction in the case of normals where positive sign defined the outer surface of the shape.\n",
    "The motivation behind this choice is that we want to keep track of which side of a surface we are measuring while moving.\n",
    "In the 2D case, it is equivalent to represent a line by a tangent or a normal in term of the number of parameters.\n",
    "However, it is usually assumed that the perceived 2D plane cuts perpendicular surfaces, so it makes more sense to use normal vector to also track the outer side of the line.\n",
    "The next figure illustrates this choice of representation for the 2D case.\n",
    "Viewpoints $\\mat{v}_n$ (i.e., where the sensor was when a point $\\mat{p}$ was measured on a surface $\\mathcal{S}$) are used to determine the direction of the normal vectors $\\mat{n}$, whereas no extra information is needed for a tangent vector $\\mat{t}$ laying on a line that can be observed from both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/normals.jpg\" width=30% />\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/tangents.jpg\" width=30.5% />\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b>Figure:</b> Difference between using normal vectors and tangent vectors to represent a 2D shape $\\mathcal{S}$.\n",
    "<em>Left</em>: The 2D line is known to be measured from a volume, which can only view from one side as illustrated with the black arrows $\\mat{v}_1$ and $\\mat{v}_2$. \n",
    "The direction of the surface make sense to be encoded in its representation leading to the choice of normal vectors $\\mat{n}$ (dashed blue arrow).\n",
    "<em>Right</em>: The same line can be observe from both direction leading to the selection of an undirected tangent vector $\\mat{t}$ (dashed blue line).\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the second derivative group, a curve is parametrized by a scalar representing curvature $\\kappa$.  Curvature can be used to represent an osculating circle parallel to the tangent of a line. \n",
    "In the case of a quadric (i.e. a curved surface), it is parametrized by principal direction vectors $\\mat{t}_\\text{min}$, $\\mat{t}_\\text{max}$ and the principal curvature scalars $\\kappa_\\text{min}, \\kappa_\\text{max}$.\n",
    "Those principal directions rely on a point $\\mat{p}$ and on the normal vector $\\mat{n}$, so they could be expressed only with one angle.\n",
    "In other words, the principal directions are tangent vectors to the surface complementing the normal vector.\n",
    "In the case of curves, the curvature is always positive as opposed to quadrics for which a positive $\\kappa$ means that the surface bend in the same direction of the normal vector and vice-versa.\n",
    "For simplicity in further computation, most of the publications use normalized 3D vectors to express normals and tangents leading to a larger set of parameters, as shown in the following table:\n",
