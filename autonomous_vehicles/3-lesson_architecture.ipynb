    "Following Merriam-Webster dictionary, we have the following definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle:\n",
    "> a means of carrying or transporting something\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous:\n",
    "> a) responding, reacting, or developing independently of the whole\n",
    ">\n",
    "> b) undertaken or carried on without outside control \n",

    "So, to be clear, an autonomous vehicle doesn't need to be a car.\n",
    "It can be a plane, a helicopter, a boat and so on.\n",
    "I tend to prefer those terms over _mobile robotics_ as a robotic arm is clearly mobile, but not so much a vehicle.\n",
    "Some key challenges of autonomous vehicles are the scale of the environment at which they need to operate and the uncertainty related to that environment.\n",
    "Another useful term to define is the word _intelligent agent_ or more often just _agent_.\n",
    "An agent is a generic term for someone or something else that should interact with you in an intelligent manner.\n",

    "There are many ways to divide the architecture of an autonomous vehicle, but they all converge these high level divisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perception**: can it understand its environment?\n",
    "- **Prediction**: can it estimates on short, medium and long terms how the environment will evolve?\n",
    "- **Decision**: can it selects a set of actions fulfilling a goal? \n",
    "- **Action**: can it realize the planed actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect with the theory teach in this lecture, everything related to the Euclidean space is heavily used for all of those steps since a robot move in 3D.\n",
    "As for the content around lidars and 3D registration, it is of course mostly related to the perception level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, I curated a list of examples and added few precisions on these divisions using research videos with interesting results.\n",
    "The goal is not for you to understand the specific methods put forward, but simply to illustrate what these level imply.\n",
    "It is important that you focus on high level concepts instead of the technical details.\n"

    "On the one hand, this is at reach when it comes to predicting the action of your own autonomous vehicle, but still under research when it comes to harsh environment like snow or ice on the ground.\n",
    "On the other hand, predicting what a human can do is very complex.\n",
    "Currently, we can predict with good accuracy the motion of a pedestrian within less than two seconds or so.\n",
    "But, let's face it, even some humans don't know themselves what they will be doing in two seconds.\n",
    "We have flashing turn signal lights since 1938 on cars and that doesn't stop someone to cut you without warning.\n",
    "Moreover, this prediction depends of cultural bias.\n",
    "For example, jaywalking is more probable in some countries than in others.\n",
