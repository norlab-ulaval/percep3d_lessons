    "The practical part of this course involves working with the Robot Operating System (ROS) running on top of the Linux distribution Ubuntu.\n",
    "The exercises expect you to have your own instance of the system to experiment with.\n",
    "There several possibilities how to proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __You already have a PC with a Ubuntu 18.04 installed on it__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Great, we will help you install the ROS and some software necessary for the course and you are good to go.\n",
    "   You can start by installing a [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu), you want the _Desktop Install_ configuration which contains all we need for the course.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. __You have a spare PC or you are willing to setup a dual-boot configuration on your PC__\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then consider installing Ubuntu 18.04 on it. When you are done, GOTO (1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __You have your Windows or Mac installation and no Linux will ever touch your hard drive__\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is actually the most probable scenario.\n",
    "   We have prepared an image of a virtual machine with Ubuntu and ROS already installed and set.\n",
    "   There is a price to pay in performance since the virtualized system cannot run as fast as a real one, yet it will allow you to do all the exercises.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "# Virtual machine download and installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how to get the virtual machine up and running.\n",
    "We provide two sub-options for you.\n",
    "There are two alternative pieces of software you can choose from: _VMware Workstation Player_ and _Oracle VirtualBox_.\n",
    "On Widows, you can choose from both, given that the _VMware Workstation Player_ virtual machine runs faster on the PC of the author of this text and is set to provide 4 virtual CPU cores compared to the _VirtualBox_, which recommends only 2 on the same machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a Mac, then your only choice is the _VirtualBox_, at least from what we offer.\n",
    "However, I have seen Apple people having a virtual Ubuntu installation somehow integrated to Mac, if that is your case, GOTO(2.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, modern x86 virtualization software depends on hardware technology making the virtual systems reasonably fast. At Intel, they call it [VT-x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_(VT-x)), AMD calls it [AMD-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#AMD_virtualization_(AMD-V)).\n",
    "And you have to turn it on in the BIOS, otherwise the virtual machine software will complain, or run slow, or not run at all.\n",
    "These screenshots demonstrate how it is done on a Lenovo laptop with an Intel CPU:\n",

    "<img src=\"virtual_machine/figures/bios2.jpg\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for something similar in the BIOS of your machine.\n",
    "When you are done with setting up your BIOS, you can proceed to one of the two virtualization software options.\n",

    "\n",
    "The system is a freshly installed Ubuntu 18.04 together with the ROS Melodic (will be used for the exercises) and few other useful programs (_vim_, _mc_, _htop_, _sl_).\n",
    "In the home folder `/home/student`, you will find a folder containing the _Paraview_ scientific data visualizer, useful for point cloud visualization.\n",
    "We have already prepared a link to the executable _Paraview_ binary, it is sufficient to type `paraview` in the terminal to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there is an empty folder `percep3d_data` intended for datasets that we will provide you for the exercises.\n",
    "The folder `percep3d_workspace` contains ROS software packages that will come handy during the ROS lessons and the mapping lessons."
