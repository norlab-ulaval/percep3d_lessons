    "## Intrinsic versus extrinsic\n",
    "\n",
    "The two first categories are whether you are using _intrinsic rotations_ or  _extrinsic rotations_.\n",
    "Intrinsic rotations are exactly what you did with your right hand in our first example.\n",
    "Each angle is applied with respect to the newly rotated frame.\n",
    "As for extrinsic rotations, each angle is applied with respect to a fixed frame.\n",
    "To try it for yourself, you will need a pen and both of your hands.\n",

    "Rotate the pen by a quarter of a turn around the thumb.\n",
    "Then, by a quarter of a turn around the index finger.\n",
    "Finally, rotate the pen by a negative quarter of a turn around your middle finger.\n",
    "Your right hand was the fixed frame and the angles were always applied in relation with this frame.\n",
    "Intrinsic rotations are the norm for vehicles and, as far as I know, extrinsic are sometimes used for robotic arms.\n",
    "Luckily, every intrinsic rotation has an equivalent extrinsic rotation, so you can easily convert from one to another.\n",
    "We will explain that conversion later and mainly focus on intrinsic rotations for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "By only considering intrinsic rotations, we still have to fix the order of the basis vectors used, which still gives us 12 valid combinations.\n",
    "It is getting so bad, that people came out with ways to encode the combinations.\n",
    "A sequence where $\\az{}$ is rotated by $\\alpha$ radians, $\\ay{}$ rotated by $\\beta$ radians, and $\\ax{}$ rotated by $\\gamma$ radians can be simply written as the convention `z-y'-x''`.\n",
    "Quotes `'` are also used to differentiate between extrinsic and intrinsic rotations.\n",
    "The convention `z-y-x` means that basis vectors are fixed (i.e., extrinsic) and `z-y'-x\"` means that basis vectors are rotated (i.e., intrinsic).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we can split our 12 combinations into two categories: _Proper Euler angles_ and _Taitâ€“Bryan angles_.\n",
    "Now you should be saying, _ark it was so easy when I was reading the joke about Swiss francs..._ and that's the point of this lesson.\n",
    "As you train to be more knowledgeable on 3D transformations, it will be up to you to ask the proper questions about the convention used by people who randomly copy-paste code from Stack Overflow.\n",
    "Trust me, I've been there."
