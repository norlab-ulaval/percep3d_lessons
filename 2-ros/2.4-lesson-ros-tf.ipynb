    "# How it works internally\n",
    "\n",
    "By design, TF is a decentralized system, where each running ROS node that uses TF keeps its own buffer of available transformations.\n",
    "By default, this buffer keeps 20 seconds of history.\n",
    "The transformations are published on the `/tf` and `/tf_static` topics, and all TF-using nodes listen to these topics.\n",
    "Each transform contains a time stamp, name of the coordinate frames (parent and child) and the actual transformation parameters (i.e., a translation vector and a quaternion encoding the rotation).\n",
    "Each coordinate frame is allowed to have maximum one parent frame.\n",
    "This constraint is a design decision taken by the authors of TF to avoid loop in the connection tree.\n",
    "Therefore, the whole set of coordinate frames is organized as directed tree, with no cycles possible.\n",
    "This helps with effective implementation and does not seriously limit the usability of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As en example, here is a transformation published on the `/tf` topic:\n",

    "You can see for yourself by executing `rostopic echo /tf` while having the rosbag from the Rviz lesson running.\n",

    "It says what is the expected position and orientation of the robot, named `base_link`, in the fixed coordinate frame, named `odom`, at that given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF then offers functions to find transformations between any two coordinate frames for any time present in the local buffer (from now to those 20 default seconds in history).\n",
    "The size of the buffer can be increased, but from our experience, usually there is no need to.\n",
    "The library also offers functions to transform vector or point coordinates between different frames.\n",
