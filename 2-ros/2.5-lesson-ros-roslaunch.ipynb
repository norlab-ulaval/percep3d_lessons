    "Its purpose is to launch groups of ROS nodes automatically based on XML text files that list the necessary nodes, their parameters and possibly includes other launch files as well.\n",

    "We will catch-up now by looking at the ROS tutorial on this topic.\n",
    "It will help us understand the contents of ROS launch files, since the ROS parameters are often used there to configure the launched ROS nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is explained in detail on the [Parameter Server](http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server) page, but it is really simple.\n",
    "The _roscore_ process can store parameters, which are accessible by all ROS nodes and also manually from a terminal.\n",
    "Each parameter has a name and a value.\n",
    "The value can be a number, a piece of text (string), logical value (True or False) and some other types.\n",
    "We can set them, read them, and clear them.\n",
    "If you terminate the _roscore_, you loose the parameters set there.\n",
    "We have already touched this mechanism before when playing with our small bag file from the DARPA competition.\n",
    "You have executed the `rosparam set use_sim_time true` command to set the `use_sim_time` parameter to the `true` value telling all the running ROS nodes that we were running with a simulated time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to familiarize more with the terminal commands related to the ROS parameters, proceed to the [Understanding ROS Services and Parameters](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams) and focus on Section 3, which shows you how to set and read ROS parameters from the parameter server.\n",
    "They let you play with parameters that configure the turtle simulator - you need one running, you can start it as usual by calling `rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node`."
