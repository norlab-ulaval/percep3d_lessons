    "Moreover, you can pause the playback by pressing the space key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall the [lesson on Rviz](2.2-lesson-ros-rviz.ipynb), we were executing an additional command before the _rosbag play_ which also had an additional parameter: `--clock`.\n",
    "Reason for this is that we recorded the bagfile in some point in history.\n",
    "All the time information stored in that bagfile is coming from a system clock of a robot that ran on February 26, 2020.\n",
    "As long as we only play a bagfile and observe data in Rviz, `rosbag play` should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we might want to run some ROS nodes that consume data from the recorded topics and also depend on current time information.\n",
    "Let's imagine a ROS node that subscribes a topic with camera images and inserts a text information to those images with current time and data, same as the old analog cameras did (photo courtesy of [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCivA7_KLKWo43tFcCkFvydw)):\n",

    "Now, your images receive a wrong time stamp, the one for the time of stamping, not for the time of taking the photo.\n",
    "ROS offers a solution for this situation: The `rosbag play --clock` option causes the rosbag player to publish a new topic called _clock_ which informs all running nodes in the ROS system about correct _\"current time\"_, the time of the bagfile.\n",
    "There is one more requirement though.\n",
    "Before running any nodes or the rosbag player, a parameter in ROS needs to be set that tells all the nodes that there will be such _clock_ topic they should listen to. \n",
    "This parameter is set by calling `rosparam set use_sim_time true`.\n",
    "We prefer to use this _simulated_ time method since it helps us avoid unpredicted behavior of our software when re-playing bagfiles.\n",
    "To recap how to play bagfiles with the _clock_ option on:\n",
    "1. Run a `roscore`.\n",
    "2. Execute `rosparam set use_sim_time true`.\n",
    "3. Play your bagfile: `rosbag play --clock my_bagfile.bag`\n",
