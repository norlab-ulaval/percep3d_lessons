    "# Description\n",
    "\n",
    "While building this lecture my goal was to give access to the most advance knowledge on 3D registration algorithms.\n",
    "Those algorithms are used around the world since almost 25 years, but very few university courses cover them fully.\n",
    "Thus, this lecture targets perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles (i.e., robots in general, not just cars), with a particular focus on point cloud processing streamed from lidar sensors.\n",
    "Themes covered are:\n",
    "- the special orthogonal group in 3D, the rotation group;\n",
    "- rigid transformations in 3D;\n",
    "- frame of references;\n",
    "- differential geometry;\n",
    "- the middleware Robot Operating System (ROS);\n",
    "- point cloud registration, including special topics on data associations, objective function, and outliers rejection;\n",
    "- when having access to the campus, field deployment of autonomous vehicles\n"

    "# Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This course presents the implications of autonomous vehicles on society and some theoretical foundations of perception algorithms allowing autonomous navigation of a vehicle in three dimensions (3D). \n",
    "We will see the limitations and advantages of the different sensors necessary for autonomous navigation. \n",
    "The algorithms for registering 3D point clouds will be explained with particular attention to the various representations of rotations from Euler angles to Lie algebra. \n",
    "When taught in hybrid mode, the practical side of the course will use a robot equipped with a 3D lidar to collect field data and create a 3D map of an area of interest on campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge acquired in this course is useful in many industrial areas such as automakers, large tech companies, game programmers, and georeferencing experts. \n",
    "For some time, the majority of automakers have been investing heavily in research and development groups to automate driving. \n",
    "One of the emerging solutions is the use of 3D sensors to locate vehicles in their environment. \n",
    "Also, the video game industry is actively looking for interactive ways to engage the player in virtual environments using 3D sensors. \n",
    "Finally, contactless inspection - whether of small objects, construction sites or machined parts - is essentially based on 3D sensors, which allow a detailed analysis of the physical characteristics of the surfaces.\n",
    "All these areas are based on common concepts of 3D reconstructions, which will be covered in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully appreciate the course, it is suggested:\n",
    "- to be functional on an operating system such as Ubuntu, \n",
    "- to have a light programming base in Python, or to be willing to invest a bit of time to transition from Matlab to Python, \n",
    "- to be able to use command line tools, and\n",
    "- to be at comfortable with vectors, linear algebra, and statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the course is given in remote or hybrid mode, participants are expected to use their personal computer.\n",
    "You are expected to have:\n",
    "- a computer with a minimum of 16 GB of rams and 20 GB of free disk space,\n",
    "- a webcam and a microphone for video conferencing\n",
    "- an Internet connection fast enough for video conferencing"

    "The main method put forward is the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom#Limitations_and_criticisms) combined with asynchronous teaching.\n",
    "To implement this method, you become responsible for your learning pace and most try the activities first.\n",
    "By reading and trying the exercises as best you can, you will be able to better identify gaps in your understanding.\n",
    "This process can be uneasy or uncomfortable for some at the beginning as it may highlight learning challenges that you are facing.\n",
    "The goal of the instructor is to support you in your learning process and answer your questions to help you connect concepts.\n",
    "This approach favour active learning, as you are responsible to search for solutions, as opposed to passive learning where you receive a stream of information in one block and try to figure out how it will be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be one video at the beginning of each module to explain the general goals of that module.\n",
    "Following your demands, there will be videos explaining concepts that triggered a lot of questions or that cannot be explained with few text lines in a chat.\n",
    "To support fast, but still asynchronous communications, we will use a dedicated instant messaging app for the lecture.\n",
    "Instruction on how to access the app will be given at the beginning of the semester.\n",

    "As for the text, you can also see how the equations were written and take notes directly in notebooks.\n",

    "- **Instant messaging** will be used for general information and to answers quick questions.\n",
    "I value quick feedbacks and would like to promote interactions instead of a unidirectional flow of information.\n",
