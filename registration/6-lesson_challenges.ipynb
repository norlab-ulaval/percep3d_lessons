    "# Guidelines for solution implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by presenting a framework of registration solutions in the [lesson Overview of registration algorithms](1-lesson_overview.ipynb) to eventually expose main application challenges through [three use cases](5-lesson_use_case_1.ipynb).\n",
    "This lesson bridge those concepts and proposes a high level guideline based the experience developed over several years implementing, tuning and testing registration solutions. \n",
    "It should be use as an investigation starting point when problems arise from a given application. \n",
    "For a more quantitative interpretation of the impact of a specific module and its parameters on registration quality, we direct readers toward [Pomerleau et al., 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-013-9327-2). \n",
    "In this lesson, we will overlook three modules the were in the tables for all use cases their selections mainly depends on the context of an application than on registration tuning.\n",
    "<em>Reading and reference sources</em> follow the sensors at hand and can be upgraded based on their specifications, but hardly for only tuning a registration solution.\n",
    "<em>Transformation parameters</em> follow the data acquisition process and the deformation resulting from moving a given sensor in the environment. \n",
    "Lastly, <em>transformation checkers</em> depend on transformation parameters used and the application.\n",
    "Detecting convergence, divergence or timeout of the algorithm can be implemented in a generic way, but the actions resulting of such events (e.g., discarding the result, restarting with other parameters or another solution) depend on the application.\n",
    "Moreover, it worth noting that some suggestions are contradictory when addressing a given challenge. \n",
    "For example, the row <em>Real-time</em> highlights the fact that point-to-plane error has a faster convergence rate, but at the same time, highlight that surface reconstruction is expensive to compute. \n",
    "The general registration strategy selected for an application may require to balance advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solutions. \n",
    "Also, cells in dark red represent configurations that were not encountered in this work, which could be an opportunity for innovation."
