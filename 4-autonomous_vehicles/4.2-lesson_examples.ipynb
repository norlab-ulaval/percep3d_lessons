    "[NIFTi](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/projects-and-publications/projects-overview/project/nifti/) (2010-2013) and [TRADR](http://www.tradr-project.eu/) (2013-2017) were funded by the European Union and from their inception had the ambition to equip mobile robots with perception and autonomy capabilities which would come handy to human operators in search and rescue missions.\n",
    "They reflect, to some degree, the development of capabilities of mobile robotic systems in that decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept was that a team of robots and humans would cooperate and leverage capabilities of each member to achieve higher safety and situation awareness for the humans in the team.\n",
    "The robots would go first in the area hit by one of several accident or disaster scenarios (industrial accident, fire in a highway tunnel or an earthquake).\n",
    "They would be equipped with a range of sensors as required by the human operators and would collect data, build 3D maps and locate possible points of interest (either potential risks for human rescuers, or the accident survivors).\n",

    "The other capability was assisted grasping by a robotic arm, which is otherwise quite challenging with the communication delay, limited field of view and the general fact of not seeing the object with one's own eyes."

    "The hardware and software was in its early version, the deployment was thus limited to line-of-sight and data collection.\n",
    "In the case of failure, the robots would not be recovered for several weeks since the areas were not considered safe for people to enter.\n",

    "There were two churches considered unsafe for human rescuers to enter - the rescue mission commander generally tries to minimize the exposure of the personnel to the dangerous zones.\n",
    "However, there was still the need to document the state of the churches inside, the extent of the damage.\n",

    "The following video shows the 3D point cloud and the video stream recorded by one of the ground robots.\n",
    "In the time 16:00 of the video, the connection to the robot was lost and the operator had to wait half an hour for the firefighters to relocate the base-station antenna to improve the reception and to continue with the mission.\n",
    "This event triggered the effort to search for even more reliable wireless communication solutions and also for methods for automatic return of the robots in the case of losing the signal."

    "The final years of the TRADR project brought advances in the partial autonomy.\n",
    "The robots were eventually able to explore and patrol a given area, yet this functionality reached the _demonstration_ level of maturity - it was necessary a considerable effort to make it run.\n",
    "Mainly because it depended on a large number of subsystems, each needed to be stable and well-behaving: the 3D mapping systems, wireless communication, planning and plan execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the remote controlled way of deployment was considered stable and even the firefighters were able to control and use the system, the autonomous functionalities continue to be developed and re-thought.\n",
    "The hardware developed during the projects stays with the former partners and in the case of the Czech Technical University, is is being deployed again in the [DARPA SubT challenge](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/research/darpa-subt-urban/) together with the robots of NORLAB from our university.\n",
    "Compared to the deployments with the firefighters, the push for autonomous functionality is much stronger given the demands and goals of the challenge.\n",
    "Because of the limited time and only one person allowed to remotely interact with the robots, the more autonomous the robots are, the more area in underground environments they can explore while potentially finding scored artifacts.\n",
