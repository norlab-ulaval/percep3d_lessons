    "Well, a 1D lidar would be a [laser rangefinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_rangefinder), you know, those small devices used to measure a distance.\n",
    "They send a laser pulse on an object and measure how much time it takes for the pulse to bounce on it and come back.\n",
    "Knowing this time and the speed at which the pulse travels (i.e., the speed of light), one can compute the distance between the lidar and the object.\n",

    "The output of such a lidar is no longer a single distance or point, but a set of points (i.e., a point cloud) in 2D.\n",
    "The position of a point is computed using the time it takes for a laser pulse to bounce back to the lidar as well as the mirror angle at the moment at which the pulse was fired.\n",
    "This will give you an angle and a distance (i.e., [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system)), which can then be converted to [2D Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_two_dimensions) in the frame of the lidar.\n",

    "Please note that this image is a rendering, actual 3D scan are not that dense, but it is reasonably close.\n",
    "If you look carefully at the layout of the points, you will be able to see the scan lines of the different lasers around the lidar.\n",
