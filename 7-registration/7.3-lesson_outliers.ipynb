    "# Rejection or hard outlier filters\n",
    "When using descriptors, it is possible to apply an <tt>outlier filter</tt>.  \n",
    "Regarding Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors, the original method proposed was to reject all matches where the distance ratio with the second best match is higher than 80 % [[Lowe, 2004]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AVISI.0000029664.99615.94). \n",
    "In [[Stewart et al., 2003]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1242341), all matches under 95 % confidence based on $\\chi^2$ uncertainty bound are rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where outliers are filtered based on features, rejection techniques mostly use a threshold based on Euclidean distance, the main difference is how thresholds are chosen.\n",
    "A naive approach is to use a maximal distance between points [[Segal et al., 2009]](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss05/p21.html). \n",
    "This technique is sometimes hidden by using a fixed radius directly in the matching function.\n",
    "Likewise, surface orientation differences between paired points can be limited to a fixed value [\\[Pulli, 1999](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/805346), [Zhang, 1994\\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01427149) or an adaptive one based on the median [[Diebel et al., 2004]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1389948).\n",
    "Adaptive methods can be based on the mean distance between points and their Standard Deviation (STD) [\\[Druon et al., 2006](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4097937), [Zhang, 1994\\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01427149), STD only [[Masuda et al., 1996]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/546150), the quartile position (a.k.a trimmed) [\\[Chetverikov et al., 2002](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1047997), [Censi, 2008](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4543181), [Armesto et al., 2010\\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509371) and the median [[Diebel et al., 2004]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1389948) of the distances of all paired points. \n",
    "In an iterative system for data association, [Pulli [1999]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/805346) proposed to  manually reduce the threshold at each iteration based on the convergence of the system. \n",
    "An automatic extension to this approach is presented in [[Pomerleau et al., 2010]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13408-1_21). \n",
    "A different type of <tt>outlier filter</tt> evaluates whether there are multiple matches from the <tt>reading</tt> to the <tt>reference</tt> and keeps only the match with the smallest distance [[Zinsser et al., 2003]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1246775)."

    "# Weighting or soft outlier filters\n",
    "\n",
    "All the methods above utilize *hard* assignment to identify outliers. \n",
    "This means that, beyond a certain threshold, the feature pair (i.e., tuple) is  discarded prior to being considered by the minimization procedure. \n",
    "Assignments can also be made *soft* by using a weighting function promoting inliers during the minimization. \n",
    "Those weighting functions can consist of the ratio of mean distance over each paired distances [[Pan et al., 2010]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5476132) or function such as Gaussian [[Godin et al., 1994]](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/2350/1/Three-dimensional-registration-using-range-and-intensity-information/10.1117/12.189139.short) or Cauchy (a.k.a. Lorentzian) [[Bosse and Zlot, 2009b]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5152851). \n",
    "Mix between *soft* and *hard* assignment are also used like one minus the ratio of the tuple distance divided by a maximum distance (with a saturation to zero when the tuple distance is over the maximum distance) [[Diebel et al., 2004]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1389948) or directly using the bisquare (a.k.a Tukey or Beaton-Tukey) function [\\[Masuda, 2001](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/924447), [Stewart et al., 2003\\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1242341). \n",
    "All those techniques use only the feature information to weight outliers.\n",
    "One example of mixing features and descriptors proximity can be founded in the work of [Godin et al. [1994]](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/2350/1/Three-dimensional-registration-using-range-and-intensity-information/10.1117/12.189139.short), where the total weight is computed by multiplying the feature distance by a reflectance similarity function."

    "A suite of tools is proposed to robustly estimate the position (i.e., robust variant of the mean) and the scale (i.e., robust variant of the STD). \n",

    "A category of M-estimator, called redescending M-estimators, have a saturation point to reject gross outliers. \n",
