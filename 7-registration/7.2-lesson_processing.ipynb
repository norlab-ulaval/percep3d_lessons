    "The different types of <tt>data filters</tt> try to augment the distinctiveness of the inputs usually by reducing the number of features and by augmenting the dimension of either the features or the descriptors.\n",
    "For example, a black and white image has a uniform distribution of features (i.e., a grid of pixels) and one dimension descriptor (i.e., the light intensity) associated to each feature. \n",
    "After some <tt>data filters</tt> are applied, only few points in the image will be kept as features and the descriptors will be increased with information from neighboring pixels, for example to 64 dimensions when using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors [[Lowe, 2004]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AVISI.0000029664.99615.94).\n",
