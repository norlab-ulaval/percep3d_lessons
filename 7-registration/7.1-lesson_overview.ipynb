    "The scope of this module is to present *registration* algorithms and their use in mobile robotics.\n",
    "Registration algorithms associate sets of coordinates into a common coordinate system by minimizing the alignment error.\n",
    "This allows to integrate coordinates from different sources into a larger model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they can be quite an abstract and technical concept, registration solutions already had an impact on the artistic field and popular culture.\n",
    "Photographers proficiently use image registration to build photograph composites achieving different looks-and-feels.\n",
    "The [Brenizer method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenizer_Method) is an exemplary technique that is applied to achieve dramatic depth of field using panoramic image stitching ([Figure 1.1](#regInPhotography) - Top).\n",
    "Another example is High Dynamic Range (HDR) photographs, where multiple images at different exposure levels need to be precisely overlaid to retrieve details in shaded and highlighted areas ([Figure 1.1](#regInPhotography) - Bottom).\n",
    "Nowadays, even the latest cellphones have the capacity to build panoramic images from a series of pictures taken based on a visual guidelines that direct the user to move the camera viewfinder at the optimal position for the next picture.\n",
    "As for the specific case of 3D mapping application, cinematographers are depicting possible uses of registration algorithms in several recent science fiction movies.\n",
    "For instance, in the remake of *Total Recall* (Colombia Pictures, 2012), an armed intervention team employed an array of hundreds of tiny cameras in a dangerous room leading to a 3D reconstruction of the area used to monitor potential threats within couple of seconds.\n",
    "If you have Netflix, go to the time 25:40 up 27:00 to to see the scene, it's interestingly accurate.\n",
    "Another closely related potential application was the used by a geologist of [flying drones carrying laser rangefinders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO-eduvo904) to explore an alien facility in *Prometheus* (Twentieth Century Fox, 2012).\n",

    "More at the research level, current applications include: robotic exploration in harsh environments, organ reconstruction to improve medical diagnostics and object reconstruction for reverse engineering. \n",
    "Although registration using 2D images can be part of the same group of solutions, we focus on systems where depth information is already available (e.g., from lidars) and is mainly used for resolving misalignment error.\n",
    "We refer to the latter type as *geometric registration*.\n",

    "A simplified example of geometric registration is illustrated in [Figure 1.2](#exampleReg).\n",
    "A scene with a large tree, a lamppost and a bench was scanned using a laser rangefinder from two different poses.\n",

    "In that example, the point cloud in light green and with the horizontal ground is used as our fixed reference coordinates.\n",
    "[Figure 1.2](#exampleReg)-*Left* shows the starting position of the two scans.\n",

    "# Early Solutions\n",
    "As an interesting historical note, in an early publication by [Hurley and Cattell [1962]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bs.3830070216), registration is presented as an *Orthogonal Procrustes* problem.\n",
    "The name Procrustes refering to a bandit from the Greek mythology who made his victims fit on his bed by either stretching their limbs or cutting them off.\n",
    "Theseus eventually defeated Procrustes using the same violent procedure ([Figure 1.3](#procrustes)).\n",
    "Nowadays, the reference to the *Orthogonal Procrustes* problem is not often used in the scientific literature, but it illustrates well the idea.\n",

    "\n",
    "While working more specifically on 3D-shape primitives, [Faugeras and Hebert [1986]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/027836498600500302) defined closed-form distances to minimize point-to-point and plane-to-plane alignment error.\n",
    "The proposed method solved translation and rotation as a two-step procedure.\n",
    "Later, a solution proposed by [Walker et al. [1991]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/104996609190036O) resolved together rotation and translation error using dual quaternions.\n",
    "The registration problem concretizes itself further in a survey of geometric matching algorithms and geometric representations for point sets, curves, surfaces, volumes, and their respective space-time trajectories [[Besl, 1988]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5966).\n",
    "At this time, the main experimental validation was using Computer-aided design (CAD) models with simple shapes.\n",
    "The first mention of the name Iterative Closest Point (ICP) was proposed by [Besl and McKay [1992]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/121791).\n",
    "They expressed the problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Given 3-D data in a sensor coordinate system, which describes a data shape that may correspond to a model shape, and given a model shape in a model coordinate system in a different geometric shape representation, estimate the optimal rotation and translation that aligns, or registers, the model shape and the data shape minimizing the distance between the shapes and thereby allowing determination of the equivalence of the shapes via a mean-square distance metric.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that is an awfully long sentence.\n",
    "If we rephrase that, it means that we can register two point clouds using a rigid transformation and minimizing a mean-square distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their work, the proof of the solution convergence is demonstrated under the assumption that the number of associated points, or their weight, remains constant.\n",
    "Unless two identical shapes are registered together, outliers that are not present in both shapes need to be identified.\n",
    "This problems is observed by [Champleboux et al. [1992]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/223223), while developing early registration solutions for medical applications.\n",
    "They report failures when wrong initial transformations are used in combination with scans having low overlap ratio.\n",
    "During the same years, [Chen and Medioni [1991]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/132043) work with dense laser scans of statues and, shortly later, scans of tooth mockups [[Chen and Medioni, 1992]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/026288569290066C).\n",
    "They propose a registration solution based on the minimization of point-to-plane alignment errors, which is still quite often used nowadays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a large volume of theoretical works was published on advanced geometric primitives (e.g., planes, curves, quadrics), [Zhang [1994]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01427149) states that primitives derived from points are too sensitive to noise and are not stable in moving systems with current (1994) sensing capabilities. \n",
    "Thus, he concludes that points were more reliable.\n",
    "[Zhang [1994]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01427149) pioneers the idea of using ICP-based solutions for outdoor robotic applications.\n",
    "He proposes a generic framework for symmetric match, but considers only one direction of registration as an approximation to save computation costs. \n",
    "He highly emphasizes the importance of removing spurious pairs and gives the first characterization of fast subsampling solutions.\n",
    "In addition, he highlighted the fact that outlier rejection is required for robotic applications, and that the proof of ICP convergence stated by [Besl and McKay [1992]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/121791) cannot hold for most of the robotics applications. \n",
    "In the outlook section of his work, he already mentions the use of uncertainty on the initial alignment, based on Kalman filters and Mahalanobis distance, and the need to handle dynamic elements."

    "# Division and Explosion of the Field\n",
    "Within only two years, four main application types already emerged from the possibilities to register 3D point clouds: object reconstructions [[Chen and Medioni, 1991]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/132043), non-contact inspections [[Besl and McKay, 1992]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/121791), medical and surgery support [[Champleboux et al., 1992]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/223223) and autonomous vehicle navigation [[Zhang, 1993]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-57233-3_60).\n",
    "Here is a video showing an example of a medical application with ICP being used for [teeth scanning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5CvlUZ5DpQ).\n",
    "Publications in specialized journals for computer vision, robotics and medical imaging slowly divided the types of *interesting* problems to be solved.\n",
    "We can still read in current literature that the credits for being the first article to provide a solution differ from authors in different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of registration crystalized with its first survey on medical image registration covering the years 1993 to 1998 [[Maintz and Viergever, 1998]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841501800268).\n",
    "It took 12 years for a specialized survey of 3D registration in computer vision to appear [[Bowyer et al., 2006]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314205000822). \n",
    "This module is based on the first large scale review adapted for Robotics application[[Pomerleau et al., 2015]](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01178661/document).\n",
    "\n",
    "ICP is a popular algorithm due to its simplicity: its general idea is easy to understand and to implement.\n",
    "However, the basic algorithm only works well in ideal cases.\n",
    "This led to hundreds of variations around the original algorithm that were published on numerous different experimental scenarios (see [Figure 1.4](#nbPublications)).\n",
    "This highlights both the usefulness of ICP and the difficulty to find a single versatile version.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Figure 1.4](#nbPublications), one can observe an increasing number of publications appearing around the year 2000.\n",
    "In robotics, this coincides with the advent of a 2D solution for pose estimations demonstrated with a SICK rangefinder [[Lu and Milios, 1997]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008854305733) and of the basis of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms [[Thrun et al., 1998]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007436523611).\n",
    "Prior to the arrival of the [SICK LMS-200](https://www.sick.com/ca/en/detection-and-ranging-solutions/2d-lidar-sensors/lms2xx/lms200-30106/p/p109843) in robotics [[Pfister et al., 2002]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1014782), most of the sensors used were custom-made.\n",
    "This situation renders experiments difficult to replicate by other researchers.\n",
    "In those years, 2D lasers appeared as a viable solution for navigation over sonars, which were traditionally used [[Thrun et al., 1998]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007436523611).\n",
    "The 3D real-time applications were then not accessible due to high computation costs leading to an increased research focus toward 2D solutions for autonomous navigation, while medical and computer graphics fields continued there research in 3D.\n",
    "At the same time in computer vision, the seminal work of [Rusinkiewicz and Levoy [2001]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/924423) on ICP algorithm comparisons led to significant progress in the scan registration field.\n",
    "The experiments employed simulated 3D scans, highlighting different spatial constraints and sensor noises.\n",
    "Results mainly focused on the rapidity of convergence and the final precision of different solutions helping to select more appropriate solutions in further applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the arrival of more standard sensors, researchers in robotics pushed research for 2D registration algorithms, in order to deal with larger environments with faster platforms [[Bosse et al., 2004]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364904049393), but 3D slowly came back [[Nüchter et al., 2004]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1308117).\n",
    "Since no comparison framework exists, the selection of an appropriate variant for particular experimental conditions is difficult.\n",
    "This is a major challenge because registration is at the front-end of the mapping pipeline, and the arbitrary nature of its selection affects the results of all subsequent steps of more advanced robotic tasks.\n",
    "Even the early work of [Eggert et al. [1998]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314298906671) highlights the difficulty to compare with other solutions given the lack of metric over common data sets.\n",

    "In addition, they highlight the imprecise use of the terms accuracy, precision and robustness. \n",
    "They suggest to set up public databases and validation protocols, but foresee logistic, costs and efforts as incoming problem to those solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the demand for a stronger experimental methodology in robotics was also stressed by [Amigoni et al. [2009]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-009-9137-8).\n",
    "The authors survey different SLAM publications to highlight proper evaluation metrics that are applied to SLAM algorithms.\n",
    "Three principles of an experimental methodology in science (i.e, comparison, reproducibility/repeatability and justification/explanation) are translated in requirements for stronger SLAM results.\n",
    "As stated in their paper, a sound methodology should allow researchers to gain an insight about *intrinsic* (e.g., computational time, parameters used, parameter behaviors) and *extrinsic* (e.g., accuracy, precision) quantities.\n",
    "The authors report that, even though comparisons between algorithms are present in SLAM publications, very few researchers can reuse the same protocol and directly compare their results without having to re-implement other solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our survey of publications on ICP stopped around 2013.\n",
    "With the introduction of the [Microsoft Kinect in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect), another wave of publications was expected, similar to what was observed following the widespread utilization of SICK rangefinders.\n",
    "The Kinect is a handheld camera sensor connected via USB to a computer that produces both depth and color readings.\n",
    "Such RGB-D sensors augment accessibility to object modeling and indoor mapping research [[Henry et al., 2012]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364911434148).\n",
    "This also opens the door to a mix of hybrid algorithms using features and descriptors without the need of expertise in sensor calibration.\n",
    "RGB-D cameras have different characteristics than laser-based sensors, such as a higher density of points at a higher frequency, but covering a more restricted Field of View (FoV).\n",
    "A smaller FoV means less time to compute the registration before the sensor trajectory reduce the overlap to an unusable range.\n",
    "Having access to a higher frame rate with an optimized ICP solution shows that hand-waved sensor trajectory was trackable with real-time constraints [[Pomerleau et al.,\n",
    "2011]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6094861).\n",
    "The Velodyne HDL-64E, first commercialized for the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007, optimized its FoV to cover the expected trajectory of a ground vehicle.\n",
    "To cope with the high speed of a car, the sensor delivered a high data rate at 1.3 M points per second, bringning the real-time constraint to another level.\n",
    "Those two sensors were the latest publication catalysts for the field of registration in mobile robotics, field often modulated by the development of new hardwares."
