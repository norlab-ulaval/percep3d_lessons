    "\n",
    "Many domains use 3D viewers (e.g., road survey, inspection of mechanical parts, aerial survey, games) and part of those domains support point clouds.\n",
    "Here is an overview of viewers that are typically used in robotics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) - Free, multi-platform, scientific visualization\n",
    "- [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/) - Open source, multi-platform, 3D meshing tools\n",
    "- [Cloud Compare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/) - Open source, multi-platform, point cloud manipulation\n",
    "- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Open source, multi-platform, 3D animations\n",
    "- [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) - Open source, used for online streaming of data within ROS\n",
    "- Multiple software from surveying companies such as Trimble, Leica, Bentley, and Faro\n",
    "- Multiple online viewers relying on html5\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, typical extensions for point clouds in open formats are:\n",
    "- `.vtk`: [The Visualization Toolkit](https://vtk.org/)\n",
    "- `.ply`: [Polygon File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format))\n",
    "- `.las`: [LASer format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAS_file_format)\n",
    "- `.csv`: Comma-Separated Values\n",
    "- `.xyz`: [this is essentially a csv format with a different extension](https://abaqus-docs.mit.edu/2017/English/SIMACAECAERefMap/simacae-c-fldusingmappointxyz.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will mostly use `.vtk` files for this lesson, but most of the viewers open all of those formats.\n",
    "On a side note, most of those viewers also open `.stl`, which is used for 3D printing.\n"

    "For those of you who know c++ well, they are also the maintainer of CMake.\n",
    "Paraview double as a scientific visualization tool, which was useful during the last ten years I was doing research.\n",
