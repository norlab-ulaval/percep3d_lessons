    "  There should be only one such element per operator.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also evaluate an operation to verify if it is **commutative**.\n",
    "For $\\SO{3}$ and $\\SE{3}$, the only operator that fulfills those four properties is the matrix multiplication.\n",
    "The inversion can be achieved through matrix inversion and the neutral element is the identity matrix $\\mat{I}$.\n",
    "Finally, multiplications in those groups are **noncommutative**.\n",
