    "Passing from $\\SE{2}$ to $\\SE{3}$ is one example, but oddly it is not to what I'm referring here for the title of this exam.\n",
    "It is rather hard to evaluate someone's skill when teaching a knowledge-based lecture.\n",

    "For this exam, I'll let you access a pool of questions covering all the lectures on Euclidean space and simply randomly draw three questions from this pool during an interview.\n",
    "Through a discussion, an instructor will determine how advance are your skills and you will be graded accordingly.\n",
    "The trade-off is the exam is quick, but its preparation might be long, depending of your tolerance to risk.\n",
    "Now, judging how advance a skill is seems pretty abstract, but this is why we have educational psychologists.\n",
    "Somewhere in 1956, the [Bloom's taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) was published.\n",
    "This taxonomy proposes categories from concrete to abstract levels of reasoning.\n",
    "The revised version of his taxonomy looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remembering**: Can you recall concepts?\n",
    "1. **Understanding**: Can you explain concepts?\n",
    "1. **Applying**: Can you reuse concepts in a similar context?\n",
    "1. **Analyzing**: Can you link concepts together?\n",
    "1. **Evaluating$^*$**: Can you make a judgment on concepts and justify it?\n",
    "1. **Creating$^*$**: Can you reorganize concepts to produce something new?\n",
