    "In other words, when we blindly receive an array with three elements, we don't ask ourselves what they mean.\n",
    "We know that the first element is associated to $\\ax{}$, the second one to $\\ay{}$ and the third one to $\\az{}$.\n",
    "But that is only by assuming a convention that everyone respects.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this is not the case with quaternions.\n",
    "In this lesson, I avoided the problem by using the vector component $\\matsym{\\epsilon}$ and the scalar component $\\eta$ in all the equations.\n",
    "In most mathematic libraries, the components will be referred to as `x`, `y`, `z`,  for the elements of the vector $\\matsym{\\epsilon}$ and `w` for the scalar $\\eta$.\n",
    "Unfortunatly, the order you need to pass these parameters to a quaternion constructor will depend of the library.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- scipy and ROS expect you to provide an array `[x, y, z, w]`\n",
    "- Matlab and Eigen expect `[w, x, y, z]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion comes from whether the notation respects the original equation from Hamilton or is a bit more aligned with matrix multiplications.\n",
    "Here is a good excerpt from Eigen's documentation that highlights well this confusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note the order of the arguments: the real `w` coefficient first, while internally the coefficients are stored in the following order: `[x, y, z, w]`.\n",

    "There is another convention problem, and that one is more specific to aerospace, with some spillover in robotics.\n",
    "A convention from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses a left-handed notation for rotations, leading to rotation matrix conversions that will flip the rotations.\n",
